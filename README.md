My name is Peter. I am an expert in security systems design and technical support. I have a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and several years of professional experience in computer and security systems integration. Over the past 10 years, I have served as a technical department manager for a variety of companies where I successfully led teams in the design installation and implementation of video surveillance, access control and data communications systems.
